# Why redir is GDPR compliant?

There are several features are supported for GDPR:

1. It is possible to hide IP addresses from collected access statistics
2. Public pages provides imprint (/s/.impressum), privacy (/s/.privacy), and contact (/s/.contact) pages. The content of all these pages can be customized.
3. When shortening a link, it is possible to set if a link is trustable or not. Any external domain links are by default untrusted. A configured trusted link will do direct redirects, and untrusted links will show a warning page to visitors then explicitly ask for permission of redirect.
